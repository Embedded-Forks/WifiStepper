        <p><strong>We Love Makers.</strong> This is a pre-release board meant to demonstrate how a DIYer could control a stepper motor using WiFi. We want to make it as easy as possible to embed a stepper motor into a professional first class project. We hope you enjoy using this board! Any feedback would be greatly appreciated: <strong>aklofas@goodrobotics.net</strong></p>
